## Stress Testing Applications and Protocols

## Denial of Service Attacks

**Typically occur when an adversary consumes all available resources of a target using rapid methods of attack**

Tool to use: hping3

* -c: count 
* -d: data size
* -S: SYN packet
* -w: window size
* -p: port

## Attacking LLMNR and NetBIOS

## Responder

**Responder is an LLMNR, NTB-NS and MDNS poisoner that can aid pentesters with poisoning name resolution services and compromising usernames and hash values with a rogue athentication server**

**Netbios**
````
* NetBIOS provides services such as protocol management, messaging and data transfer and host name resolution.
* Done over UDP ports 137-139
* Typically found on local area networks
````

**LLMNR**
````
A protocol that mimics the functionality of DNS for IPv4 and IPv6 host name resolution for hosts operating on small networks.
* Operates over UDP port 5355
````

````
LLMNR and NetBT components are subject to spoofing by poisoning name service components by impersonating legitimate hosts listening 
on the network and respoding to target service requests, such as mounting a network drive.
