### DNS Spoofing
* An attack method used to impersonate a victim's DNS server, forcing them to navigate to a malicious website.
* This attack is accomplished through MitM (Man in The Middle).
* The goal is to exploit the target with a malicious redirect or steal sensitive information from a fake web page.

### DNS Cache Poisoning
* The DNS resolver cache is overwritten on the DNS server with a malicious web address, and the user will receive the malicious site instead of the intended one.

**Use Ettercap in Kali to conduct these attacks**

## Ettercap DNS

1) Modify the etter.dns file
* The file is located in /etc/ettercap/etter.dns
* Add an entry to the file for the domain name example.com and have it point to your kali box.
